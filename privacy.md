## Privacy notice

As a business, I have both moral
and legal obligations relating to how I process personal data.  This
document aims to give you information about how and why I process your
data, and what rights you have with respect to that data.

### The data I collect and hold

As part of the business, I may collect and hold any or all of the following
pieces of personal data:

-   Contact details, including names, phone numbers, email addresses and postal
    addresses.  Where I am dealing with you as a representative of a company
    (such as your employer), this may also include your job title and
    employer's details.

    -   This is necessary so I can get in touch with you, and so when you get
        in touch with me, I know who you are.
    -   I will normally get this information directly from you, or it might be
        given to me by your employer.  Occasionally it might be given to me by
        a third party, for example if someone is recommending your services.

-   Payment and transaction details, including how we pay each other, what
    payments we may have made to each other or owe to each other, and what
    those payments are for.

    -   This is necessary so I know how much I owe you, or how much you owe
        me.
    -   I will get this data from you directly, or via our bank or other
        payment processor.

-   Communication data, such as the content of, and data associated with,
    emails and phone calls.

    -   This is necessary so I can communicate with you, and so I can
        maintain records of our agreements and discussions with you.
    -   I will get this data from you directly, or from normal third-party
        data processing, such as your phone number being displayed when you
        call me.

-   Identification documents, such as copies of passports or residency
    documentation.

    -   This is to allow me to comply with our legal and contractual
        obligations, such as recording your "Right to rent".
    -   I will normally get this information from you directly.  With your
        explicit consent, I may also solicit this information from third
        parties.

### Why I collect this data

By law, I am required to have specific reasons and "bases" for processing
your data.  These may be:

-   If you are a tenant or potential tenant, I need to process your data to
    start and maintain the tenancy.  For most of this processing, this will be
    on the basis of our contract or potential contract; for some parts it will
    be to comply with my legal obligations.

-   If you are a tenant, I will pass your
    data onto third parties who provide services to you, such as utility
    companies and local authorities.  Depending
    on the circumstances, the basis for this will be either your consent, my
    legitimate interests, or my legal obligations.

-   If you are a contractor, I need to process your data for the purpose of
    entering into contracts with you.

-   If you are an employee of a business with which I have a relationship, I
    may need to process your personal data for the purposes of that
    relationship, such as because you are the person I am dealing with at
    your employer.  This will be on the basis of my legitimate interest.

-   If I have a business relationship with your or your employer, I may need
    to keep records in anticipation of future legal or contractual needs, such
    as to demonstrate compliance with a leasehold agreement or to show I have
    had complied with gas safety law.  This will be on the basis of my legal
    obligations or my legitimate interests.

-   I will share your data with third parties who provide services to me, for
    example with banks and accountants to who process my financial data,
    with service providers who provide storage for my address books or email
    data, or with contractors who perform work at the property.  This will
    generally be on the basis of my legitimate interests, to
    comply with my legal obligations, or on the basis of our contract or
    potential contract.

In particular, I do not, and have no interest in, selling your data to third
parties or using it for any direct marketing purposes.

### Special category data

If you are a tenant or potential tenant, I may store and process "special
category data", primarily data about your health.  This is because, as a
responsible landlord, I need to account for your needs – including needs
you have because of your health or disabilities – in ensuring a property
is fit for use, and in making reasonable adaptions to ensure it is fit for
use.

I will process this data on the basis of your explicit consent.  In limited
circumstances, for example if I need to ask a contractor to visit the
property for the purposes of emergency repairs, I will also process and
potentially pass on this data on the basis of vital interests.

### Data retention

As a small business processing limited data, I do not have a detailed
data retention policy.  However, I review the personal data we hold on at
least an annual basis, and delete or anonymize any data I do not need to
process for one of the purposes detailed above.

### Your rights

Under UK data protection laws, your rights include:

-   Access: you can ask me to provide copies of any personal data I hold
    about you.
-   Rectification: you can ask me to correct data I hold that is
    incorrect, or to complete data I hold that is incomplete.
-   Erasure: in certain circumstances, you can ask me to erase your personal
    data.
-   Restriction of processing: in certain circumstances, you can ask me to
    restrict the processing I perform of your data.
-   Objection to processing: in certain circumstances, you can ask me to stop
    processing your data entirely.
-   Portability: in certain circumstances, you can ask me to pass your data to
    you or to another organisation.

If you wish to exercise your rights, you can contact me
using any normal means you have of communicating with
me.  Mine is a very small business, but I take our legal
and moral data protection obligations seriously; I will both acknowledge
receipt of any request, and provide a full response, as soon as I am
reasonably able.

### Complaints
