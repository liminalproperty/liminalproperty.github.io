## Privacy notice

As a business, Adam Dinwoodie, trading as Liminal Property ("Liminal", we, us, &c.) has both moral
and legal obligations relating to how it processes personal data.  This
document aims to give you information about how and why Liminal processes your
data, and what rights you have with respect to that data.

### The data Liminal collects and holds

As part of the business, we may collect and hold any or all of the following
pieces of personal data:

-   Contact details, including names, phone numbers, email addresses and postal
    addresses.  Where we are dealing with you as a representative of a company
    (such as your employer), this may also include your job title and
    employer's details.

    -   This is necessary so we can get in touch with you, and so when you get
        in touch with us we know who you are.
    -   We will normally get this information directly from you, or it might be
        given to us by your employer.  Occasionally it might be given to us by
        a third party, for example if someone is recommending your services.

-   Payment and transaction details, including how we pay each other, what
    payments we may have made to each other or owe to each other, and what
    those payments are for.

    -   This is necessary so we know how much we owe you, or how much you owe
        us.
    -   We will get this data from you directly, or via our bank or other
        payment processor.

-   Communication data, such as the content of, and data associated with,
    emails and phone calls.

    -   This is necessary so we can communicate with you, and so we can
        maintain records of our agreements and discussions with you.
    -   We will get this data from you directly, or from normal third-party
        data processing, such as your phone number being displayed when you
        call us.

-   Identification documents, such as copies of passports or residency
    documentation.

    -   This is to allow us to comply with our legal and contractual
        obligations, such as recording your "Right to rent".
    -   We will normally get this information from you directly.  With your
        explicit consent, we may also solicit this information from third
        parties.

### Why Liminal collects this data

By law, we are required to have specific reasons and "bases" for processing
your data.  These may be:

-   If you are a tenant or potential tenant, we need to process your data to
    start and maintain the tenancy.  For most of this processing, this will be
    on the basis of our contract or potential contract; for some parts it will
    be to comply with our legal obligations.

-   If you are a tenant, we may need to pass your data onto third parties, for
    example so a contractor can attend to perform maintenance work.  Depending
    on the circumstances, the basis for this will be either your consent, our
    legitimate interests, or our legal obligations.

-   If you are a contractor, we need to process your data for the purpose of
    entering into contracts with you.

-   If you are an employee of a business with which we have a relationship, we
    may need to process your personal data for the purposes of that
    relationship, such as because you are the person we are dealing with at
    your employer.  This will be on the basis of our legitimate interest.

-   If we have a business relationship with your or your employer, we may need
    to keep records in anticipation of future legal or contractual needs, such
    as to demonstrate compliance with a leasehold agreement or to show we have
    had complied with gas safety law.  This will be on the basis of our legal
    obligations or our legitimate interests.

In particular, we do not, and have no interest in, selling your data to third
parties or using it for any direct marketing purposes.

### Data retention

As a small business processing limited data, Liminal does not have a detailed
data retention policy.  However, we review the personal data we hold on at
least an annual basis, and delete or anonymize any data we do not need to
process for one of the purposes detailed above.

### Your rights

Under UK data protection laws, your rights include:

-   Access: you can ask Liminal to provide copies of any personal data we hold
    about you.
-   Rectification: you can ask Liminal to correct data we hold that is
    incorrect, or to complete data we hold that is incomplete.
-   Erasure: in certain circumstances, you can ask us to erase your personal
    data.
-   Restriction of processing: in certain circumstances, you can ask us to
    restrict the processing we perform of your data.
-   Objection to processing: in certain circumstances, you can ask us to stop
    processing your data entirely.
-   Portability: in certain circumstances, you can ask us to pass your data to
    you or to another organisation.

If you wish to exercise your rights, you can contact us
using any normal means you have of communicating with
us.  Liminal Property is a very small business, but we take our legal
and moral data protection obligations seriously; we will both acknowledge
receipt of any request, and provide a full response, as soon as we are
reasonably able.
